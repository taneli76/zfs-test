This is (supposed to be) the ZFS Test Suite, with support for all platforms
that ZFS from Sun Solaris have been ported to.


To setup the test suite, run

   ./autogen.sh

This will create the configure file. Run this to setup the makefiles etc.

   ./configure

Then, to run the test suite, just issue the command:

   make test

It will require that your environment is setup in a certain way, but
the Makefile will make sure to check this. Most of it any way...

To run specific gest group(s), make a copy of the

   cp test/zfs-tests/runfiles/linux.run test/zfs-tests/runfiles/linux.run.tmp

file, edit it (uncomment or delete all that shouldn't be run) and set
the RUNFILE variable:

     export RUNFILE="-c test/zfs-tests/runfiles/linux.run.tmp"


                             CAVEATS
========================================================================
* The user zfs-test needs to be able to run sudo without issuing a
  password.

* To run the Test Suite, it is also required that you have a built ZoL
  zfs repository in:

	/var/lib/dkms/zfs/${VERSION}/build
	/usr/src/zfs-${VERSION}/${LINUX_VERSION}
	/usr/src/zfs-${VERSION}
	../zfs

* You will need quite a lot of free space on /var/tmp (which needs
  to be 'rwxrwxrwt') for temporary files etc. At least 100GB seems
  to be required.
